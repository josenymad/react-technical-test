# NASA search engine

This project was a mock technical test to create an image search engine using React.

## Brief

You are expected to build a React web application that allows users to search for images based on a query relating to space. You are provided the NASA API endpoint for image search.

## Packages & Frameworks

- React and Testing Library
- Jest 
- Axios for API requests 

## Instructions

- Fork and clone this repo.
- Navigate to the directory created on your machine, and run `npm install` to download the dependencies.
- To load the app on your browser, run `npm start`.
- You can run the tests using `npm test`.

## Additional features

With more time, I would've added an option for the user to receive more than just images.

The API can return audio and video media too, so I would've liked to give the user the option to choose between different media types (or all media types) to be received.
